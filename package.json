  "description": "This toolbox is design to avoid the fucking huge fear I have when I do open source project and when I stream of leaking my keys. I was not affraid to much of that. Until I start doing cryptomoney and shit xD. If like me you don t want to lose your Ether because in an old commit you used and key to make a test and accidently pushed it... Did not happen but that my biggest fear. Feel free to use my too and to suggestion improvement. Kind regards, Eloi S.",
